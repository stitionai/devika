## About

Devika is an advanced AI software engineer that can understand high-level human instructions, break them down into steps, research relevant information, and write code to achieve the given objective. Devika utilizes large language models, planning and reasoning algorithms, and web browsing abilities to intelligently develop software.

Devika aims to revolutionize the way we build software by providing an AI pair programmer who can take on complex coding tasks with minimal human guidance. Whether you need to create a new feature, fix a bug, or develop an entire project from scratch, Devika is here to assist you.

> [!NOTE]
> Devika is modeled after [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin) by Cognition AI. This project aims to be an open-source alternative to Devin with an "overly ambitious" goal to meet the same score as Devin in the [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) Benchmarks... and eventually beat it?

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd devika
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies (you can use any virtual environment manager):
   ```bash
   uv venv
   
   # On macOS and Linux.
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows.
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install the playwright for browsering capabilities:
   ```bash
   playwright install --with-deps # installs browsers in playwright (and their deps) if required
   ```
5. Start the Devika server:
   ```bash
   python devika.py
   ```
6. if everything is working fine, you see the following output:
   ```bash
   root: INFO   : Devika is up and running!
   ```
7. Now, for frontend, open a new terminal and navigate to the `ui` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ui/
   bun install
   bun run start
   ```
8. Access the Devika web interface by opening a browser and navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`

### how to use

To start using Devika, follow these steps:

1. Open the Devika web interface in your browser.
2. To create a project, click on 'select project' and then click on 'new project'.
3. Select the search engine and model configuration for your project.
4. In the chat interface, provide a high-level objective or task description for Devika to work on.
5. Devika will process your request, break it down into steps, and start working on the task.
6. Monitor Devika's progress, view generated code, and provide additional guidance or feedback as needed.
7. Once Devika completes the task, review the generated code and project files.
8. Iterate and refine the project as desired by providing further instructions or modifications.

## Configuration

Devika requires certain configuration settings and API keys to function properly:

when you first time run Devika, it will create a `config.toml` file for you in the root directory. You can configure the following settings in the settings page via UI:

- API KEYS
   - `BING`: Your Bing Search API key for web searching capabilities.
   - `GOOGLE_SEARCH`: Your Google Search API key for web searching capabilities.
   - `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`: Your Google Search Engine ID for web searching using Google.
   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing GPT models.
   - `GEMINI`: Your Gemini API key for accessing Gemini models.
   - `CLAUDE`: Your Anthropic API key for accessing Claude models.
   - `MISTRAL`: Your Mistral API key for accessing Mistral models.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key for accessing Groq models.
   - `NETLIFY`: Your Netlify API key for deploying and managing web projects.

- API_ENDPOINTS
   - `BING`: The Bing API endpoint for web searching.
   - `GOOGLE`: The Google API endpoint for web searching.
   - `OLLAMA`: The Ollama API endpoint for accessing Local LLMs.
   - `OPENAI`: The OpenAI API endpoint for accessing OpenAI models.

Make sure to keep your API keys secure and do not share them publicly. For setting up the Bing and Google search API keys, follow the instructions in the [search engine setup](docs/Installation/search_engine.md)


The reasoning engine constantly evaluates the progress and makes adjustments to the plan based on new information or feedback received during execution.

### Keyword Extraction

To enable focused research and information gathering, Devika employs keyword extraction techniques. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: The input text (objective, conversation history, or project files) is preprocessed by removing stop words, tokenizing, and normalizing the text.
2. **Keyword Identification**: Devika uses the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to identify important keywords and phrases from the preprocessed text. BERT's pre-training on a large corpus allows it to capture semantic relationships and understand the significance of words in the given context.
3. **Keyword Ranking**: The identified keywords are ranked based on their relevance and importance to the task at hand. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and TextRank are used to assign scores to each keyword.
4. **Keyword Selection**: The top-ranked keywords are selected as the most relevant and informative for the current context. These keywords are used to guide the research and information gathering process.

By extracting contextually relevant keywords, Devika can focus its research efforts and retrieve pertinent information to assist in the task completion.

### Browser Interaction

Devika incorporates browser interaction capabilities to navigate websites, extract information, and interact with web elements. The browser interaction module leverages the Playwright library to automate web interactions. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Navigation**: Devika uses Playwright to navigate to specific URLs or perform searches based on the keywords or requirements provided.
2. **Element Interaction**: Playwright allows Devika to interact with web elements such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and extracting text from specific elements.
3. **Page Parsing**: Devika parses the HTML structure of the web pages visited to extract relevant information. It uses techniques like CSS selectors and XPath to locate and extract specific data points.
4. **JavaScript Execution**: Playwright enables Devika to execute JavaScript code within the browser context, allowing for dynamic interactions and data retrieval.
5. **Screenshot Capture**: Devika can capture screenshots of the web pages visited, which can be useful for visual reference or debugging purposes.

The browser interaction module empowers Devika to gather information from the web, interact with online resources, and incorporate real-time data into its decision-making and code generation processes.

### Code Writing

Devika's code writing module generates code based on the plan, research findings, and user requirements. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Language Selection**: Devika identifies the programming language specified by the user or infers it based on the project context.
2. **Code Structure Generation**: Based on the plan and language-specific patterns, Devika generates the high-level structure of the code, including classes, functions, and modules.
3. **Code Population**: Devika fills in the code structure with specific logic, algorithms, and data manipulation statements. It leverages the research findings, code snippets from the knowledge base, and its own understanding of programming concepts to generate meaningful code.
4. **Code Formatting**: The generated code is formatted according to the language-specific conventions and best practices to ensure readability and maintainability.
5. **Code Review and Refinement**: Devika reviews the generated code for syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and potential improvements. It iteratively refines the code based on its own analysis and any feedback provided by the user.

Devika's code writing capabilities enable it to generate functional and efficient code in various programming languages, taking into account the specific requirements and context of each project.
