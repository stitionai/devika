## About

Devika is an advanced AI software engineer that can understand high-level human instructions, break them down into steps, research relevant information, and write code to achieve the given objective. Devika utilizes large language models, planning and reasoning algorithms, and web browsing abilities to intelligently develop software.

Devika aims to revolutionize the way we build software by providing an AI pair programmer who can take on complex coding tasks with minimal human guidance. Whether you need to create a new feature, fix a bug, or develop an entire project from scratch, Devika is here to assist you.

> [!NOTE]
> Devika is modeled after [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin) by Cognition AI. This project aims to be an open-source alternative to Devin with an "overly ambitious" goal to meet the same score as Devin in the [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) Benchmarks... and eventually beat it?

## Getting Started

### Requirements
```
Version's requirements
  - Python >= 3.10 and < 3.12
  - NodeJs >= 18
  - bun
```

- Install uv - Python Package manager [download](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Install bun - JavaScript runtime [download](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- For ollama [ollama setup guide](docs/Installation/ollama.md) (optinal: if you don't want to use the local models then you can skip this step)
- For API models, configure the API keys via setting page in UI.

### Installation

To install Devika, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Devika repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stitionai/devika.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd devika
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies (you can use any virtual environment manager):
   ```bash
   uv venv
   
   # On macOS and Linux.
