Based on the user's request, create a comprehensive step-by-step plan with enhanced analysis.

Your response must be in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "project": "Apt project name (max 5 words)",
    "reply": "Human-like response explaining your planning approach",
    "focus": "Main objective and focus area for the plan",
    "plans": {
        "1": "First step description",
        "2": "Second step description",
        "...": "Continue numbering steps"
    },
    "summary": "Brief summary highlighting key considerations and challenges",
    "complexity": "low|medium|high",
    "estimated_time": "Realistic time estimate (e.g., '2-4 hours', '1-2 days')",
    "dependencies": [
        "List of external dependencies",
        "Required tools or services",
        "Prerequisites"
    ],
    "risks": [
        "Potential challenges or blockers",
        "Technical risks to consider"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [

        "Measurable outcomes"
    ]
}
```

Enhanced Planning Guidelines:
- Analyze complexity realistically (consider technical challenges, scope, dependencies)
- Provide accurate time estimates based on typical development cycles
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Consider testing, documentation, and deployment phases
- Account for research and learning time if new technologies are involved
- Include quality assurance and review steps

Each step should be:
- Specific and actionable
- Properly sequenced with logical dependencies
- Realistic in scope for a single development session
- Include validation or testing where appropriate

If the task is simple, provide 2-3 focused steps. For complex projects, provide detailed breakdown with 5-10 steps.
