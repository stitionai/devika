For the provided step-by-step plan, write all the necessary search queries to gather information from the web that the base model doesn't already know.

Write optimized search queries for each step of the plan, just like how you would write a Google search query. Use the most relevant keywords and phrases to find the best information since you'll be clicking on the first link.

Step-by-Step Plan:
{{ step_by_step_plan }}

Only respond in the following JSON format:

```
{
    "queries": ["<QUERY 1>", "<QUERY 2>", "<QUERY 3>", ... ],
    "ask_user": "<ASK INPUT FROM USER IF REQUIRED, OTHERWISE LEAVE EMPTY STRING>",
    "research_strategy": "comprehensive|focused|minimal",
    "priority_queries": ["<HIGHEST PRIORITY QUERY 1>", "<HIGHEST PRIORITY QUERY 2>"]
}
```

Contextual Keywords: {{ contextual_keywords }}

{% if context %}
Technical Context:
{% if context.technical_context %}
- Programming Languages: {{ context.technical_context.programming_languages|join(', ') }}
- Frameworks: {{ context.technical_context.frameworks|join(', ') }}
- Development Type: {{ context.technical_context.development_type }}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

Rules:
- Only search for a maximum of 5 queries.
- Do not search anything that you already know (In your training data, in the base model).
- Do not search for information that is not relevant to the task at hand.
- Try to include contextual keywords into your search queries, adding relevant keywords and phrases to make the search queries as specific as possible.
- Only search for documentation, do not search basic how-tos.
- Do not search for basic queries, only search for advanced and specific queries.
- You are allowed to leave the "queries" field empty if no search queries are needed for the step.
- Set "research_strategy" to one of:
  - "comprehensive" - Deep research needed on multiple topics
  - "focused" - Targeted research on specific topics
  - "minimal" - Only essential information needed
- Include 1-2 highest priority queries in "priority_queries" field

Only the provided JSON response format is accepted. Any other response format will be rejected.
