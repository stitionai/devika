{% if performance_metrics %}
Performance Metrics:
```
{{ performance_metrics }}
```
{% endif %}

Analyze the code for performance bottlenecks and provide optimization recommendations.

Your response should be in the following JSON format:

```
{
    "analysis": {
        "overall_performance_score": 7.5,
        "bottlenecks": [

        }
    ],
    "monitoring_suggestions": [
        "Suggestions for performance monitoring and metrics"
    ]
}
```

Focus on:
1. Algorithm complexity analysis
2. Database query optimization
3. Memory usage patterns
4. I/O operations efficiency
5. Caching opportunities
6. Concurrent processing possibilities

Any response other than the JSON format will be rejected by the system.
