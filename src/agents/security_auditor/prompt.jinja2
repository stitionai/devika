Audit Type: {{ audit_type }}

Perform a comprehensive security audit focusing on:

1. **Input Validation**: Check for proper sanitization and validation
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Review access controls
3. **Data Protection**: Assess encryption and data handling
4. **Injection Attacks**: Look for SQL, XSS, command injection vulnerabilities
5. **Configuration Security**: Check for secure defaults and configurations
6. **Dependencies**: Analyze third-party library security
7. **Error Handling**: Ensure no sensitive information leakage
8. **Logging & Monitoring**: Verify security event logging

Your response should be in the following JSON format:

```
